# SQL HR Analytics Project â€“ Employee Database

## Project Overview

This project showcases SQL expertise by building and querying an **Employee Database**. It demonstrates practical HR analytics tasks such as employee performance evaluation, salary distribution, ranking, reporting hierarchy, and role validation. The project applies advanced SQL techniques to solve real-world business problems.

## Key Features

* **Employee Information Retrieval:** Fetch employee details with department, role, and ratings.
* **Performance Insights:** Filter employees by rating thresholds and calculate bonuses.
* **Concatenation & Aliases:** Combine first and last names for clean reporting.
